CleenCards
==========
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Javascript helper tool that formats a csv of card attributes into printable cards I can use for game testing.

CleenCards runs on [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/). In order to run it you'll have to

       cd CleenCards
       python main.py --port=3000

Then point your browser to 

       http://localhost:3000

__Note:__ without a properly formatted set of .csv files this app will error. One day the tool will be made to handle any of csv, but for now, _courage_.
